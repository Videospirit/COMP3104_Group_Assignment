DevOps Information File

DevOps short for Development and Operations are a set of practices that bring together both software development and
 IT operations. Devops came about from applying Agile and Lean approches to operations work. The use of DevOps practices
 allows for faster delivery of application in an open marketplace. Due to the fact that it conjoins development and operation 
teams it allows for fewer overlaps in the bussiness process which in hand speeds up the process. The devops lifecyle contains
 6 steps that are all integrated, these steps include: Build, Plan, Monitor, Operate, Continuous integration and development,
 and Continuous feedback. DevOps engineers use specific devops tools to assist them with each step in the lifcyle. 
The key benifits of devops approach are, speed, accuracy, security, imporved collaboration amongst employees and rapid deployemnt.
 Due to these reasons, any bussinesses in the technology field are now choosing to use a DevOps apporach in ther workspace
 in an attempt to improve there product.
