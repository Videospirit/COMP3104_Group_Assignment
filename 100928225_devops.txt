This file will contain information about COMP 3104 DevOps course.

The COMP 3104 DevOps course at George Brown College is a somewhat awkward experience. Coming after 4 semesters chock full of group work, many of the
skills taught in the course the students were forced to learn on our own in order to work effectively in a team. Compound that with the fact the 
instructions given for the weekly exercises don't work correctly on every workstation the students attending the program remotely are using only
serves to frustrate the students. I'll refrain from discussing the confusion caused by the differences between the instructors of the different 
sections having to transfer to our section as well, as that's kind of a freak occurance that is unlikely to be a common issu. It does suggest that 
some standardization of the curriculum could be of benefit however, as the Section A and B students were clearly having a very different learning 
experience before they joined us.


I highly recommend expanding on the exercise documentation to help resolve any errors discovered during the course, and moving the course to semester
1 of the program.
