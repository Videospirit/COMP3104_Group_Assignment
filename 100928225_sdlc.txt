This file will contain details about the importance of learning DevOps engineering to the software development cycle.

I'm a very informal person, so I don't put much weight into using proper terminology, so forgive me if this sounds a little pedestrian.

The main benefits of learning DevOps engineering are that you can make much better plans when working on any kind of software project. You could 
theoretically go through a project without any kind of plan at all and still have it succeed, but proper DevOps engineering can speed development up,
greatly reduces risks, and makes far more scalable projects than disorganized freestyle projects. Some might say that only the project managers and 
those creating the plans need to understand how the entire development cycle works, and they'd probably be right for the most part. Effective leaders 
can create plans that developers just need to follow, but if developers understand the philosophy themselves they can better anticipate future needs
and avoid less scalable practices, increasing their efficiency. Plus, not everyone's perfect, and plans can have flaws. The more members of a project
understand DevOps engineering, the more likely they are to improve on their plans.
